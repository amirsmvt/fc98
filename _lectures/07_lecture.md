# tldr: "We started off by introducing our plan for the Hackathon. We then moved on to write/use some command line scripts to clone student repositories and then started looking at one student's implementation of the make_rocket homework. Then we wrote a simple function to make the rocket head. Finally we continued our progress on Python with default parameters, variable types and type conversions. Students are expected to work on excersizes in the 2.5 section of Vance Morrison's course notes and push them on git under the A1 folder. We will continue our discussion tomrrow at 1pm."
