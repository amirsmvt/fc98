tldr: We started the day by cleaning up our git repository by removing all .git file sand *cache* python files and adding a .gitignore file to not add these files to the repo again. Next, did some bit manipulation in C and used the gdb debugger from VSCode to view the memory. Next, played with various features in MS-Word and explained the WYSIWYG model. Finally, we installed MikTeX and VSCode LaTeX extension to build LaTeX documents in vscode.
