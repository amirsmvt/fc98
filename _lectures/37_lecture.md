tldr: Today we started with argc/argv and how to use them. Next we moved onto char** and int** examples for multi dimensional arrays. We also explained const pointers and pointers to const in addition to observing how pointers are different in 64bit binaries. Finally we demonstrated how using function pointers can simplify code.
