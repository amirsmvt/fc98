tldr: Today we introduced struct, the "." and "->" operators and how struct is laid out in memory. We also used the -exec x/16xb commands in the debugger console inside vscode to inspect memory. We demonstrated how passing by value differs from passing by pointer for a struct variable. Next, we introduced const and typedef in addition to answering questions about string literals in C. Finally, we explained how compiling and linking code are related in C and how they can be done in separate steps.
