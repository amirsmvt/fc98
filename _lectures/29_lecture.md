tldr: Once again we reviewed git concepts. Next, we talked about what is involved in learning a new language. We touched on many topics such as compiling vs linking, .C and .H files, compiler options and for/while/if statements. Finally, we introuced the & and * operators and introduced arrays and demonstrated how we can use pointer arithmetic to access array elements.
