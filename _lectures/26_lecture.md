tldr: Today we reviewed basic concents in GIT and how it can be used to maintain a holy/clean/tested version of our code/software. We explained how to define a build on Azure that would build and test our code and set it as a branch policy. Finally, we showed how we plan to use git and Azure DevOps platform to take an exam.
