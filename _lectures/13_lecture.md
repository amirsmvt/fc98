tldr: "In this session students followed along with creating HTML files and using bootstrap components to make it pretty. Next, they went through a simple django demo to create a single model with two pages, one for add and another one for viewing all data. The commands.txt referenced in the second video can be found in the attached Lab4.zip code file along with the entire django_demo1 folde. Use <a href=%22https%3A%2F%2Fdownloads.sourceforge.net%2Fwinmerge%2FWinMerge-2.16.4-Setup.exe%22>this</a> link to download and install WinMerge. Don't forget to add it (C%3A%5CProgram%20Files%20(x86)%5CWinMerge) to the environment path so you can call winmergeu.exe from anywhere without entering the full path."
