# tldr: "We started off by explaining prerequisites to tomorrow's computer lab. We then explained how hard drives work and handed out hard drives for craft projects. All students must create a blog post on their website on creating their craft (or choose another topic of interest if you are not making a craft). We then talked about what a compiler does and looked at some disassembled code in visual studio. We explained how a variable is just a memory address. We stepped through code to see how the memory is updated as we change variable values. Finally, we wrote some simple python code to print out a space ship and start making functions to reduce repititions."
