tldr: We first reviewed git and Azure DevOps and troubleshooted some issues students were having. Next, we introduced the C and C++ languages and their differences. We then created a helloworld program and compiled and ran it from the command line. We introduced the main function, how to capture its return value through %ERRORLEVEL% and how to capture parameters passed to the exectuable through the argc and argv parameters. We finally introduced the prinf and scanf functions. The assignment for this session is to redo the Rocket assignment from the Python program.
