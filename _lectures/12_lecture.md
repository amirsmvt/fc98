tldr: "We spent all of today on what a web application is. We started off with an example web app and explained what we mean by DESIGNING the wireframe user interface of an app on mockflow. Next, we explained what HTML is and how it can be used to develop an application. We showed how a Django template can leverage python to create different HTML pages and how different HTML pages can be used to create any user interface. We also talked about javascript and how that can be used to alter HTML elements without contacting the server. We finally introduced the Bootstrap css/javascript library to easily create nice UI elements. At the end we also briefly talked about what a database is and how it can be used to store data. Please see the video and attached code for more info. PS: The VS-Code extensions we used for web development were: Auto Complete Tag, Beautify, Live Server, Bootstrap 4.
