tldr: The first part of the lab was lead by Mr. Shaheenfar for multidimensional arrays, structs and function pointers (not on tape). For, the second part, after a quick review of the upcoming C assignment, we explained how compiling and linking are two separate steps in the build process. Next, we learned how to configure VSCode tasks to compile, link, ... with different configurations.
