tldr: We warmed up today with a more in depth view of how the 'for' loop works. Next, we moved onto operators, more specifically bit operators like and,or,xor,shift-left and shift right. We then wrote a function to write a number in binary format. In the process, we also saw how ASCII codes work in variables of type char and also saw the the ternary operator.
