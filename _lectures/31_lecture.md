tldr: Today we reinforced the idea of a variable being a place in memory through the visual studio memory viewer. We also demonstrated what a pointer is through & operator and also the dereferencing operator, *. We then showed how an array of characters is allocated and assigned in memory, in addition to how the null terminator is used in C. We then used what we learned to implement a function that repeats a character string n times. Finally, we introduced the use of pointers to return multiple values from a function.
