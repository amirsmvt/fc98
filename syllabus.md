# Attendance Policy
According to univesity guidlines, students who miss more than 6 sessions are not eligable for a passing grade. University guidelines will be followed. If you cannot attend a session **always** contact the instructor ahead of time with a valid reason. Depending on your reason and record, the instructor may decide to not count your absency for that session.
