Any student involved in cheating (provider or receiver) will receive a failing grade along with a report to the University Decipline office. If you don't have the time to help your friend, do not provide them with the answer. You will fail the course! Never, ever show your code or homework to anyone.

# Assignments
Written and programming assignment submission are not accepted after the deadline. If you are late, submit what you have and start working on the next assignment.

# Attendance Policy
According to univesity guidlines, students who miss more than 6 sessions are not eligable for a passing grade. University guidelines will be followed. If you cannot attend a session **always** contact the instructor ahead of time with a valid reason. Depending on your reason and record, the instructor may decide to not count your absency for that session.
